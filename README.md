So I have never written code in ruby or rails. I am most comfortable using express and node. 

I thought this was interesting nonetheless. Overall I feel like I learned more about server side code. 

I work full time and learn code in my spare time, I do not think its good for me to switch between node/express and ruby. I want to really focus on one language at a time and become comfortable. 

I cannot complete this assignment. I made it to step 1, I coudlnt implement the sortBy function or the direction function.
